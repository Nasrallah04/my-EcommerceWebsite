What is a serverless function?
A serverless function is a piece of code that is deployed to a cloud provider and runs on demand. The cloud provider takes care of the infrastructure and scaling so you don't have to worry about it. You only pay for the time your function is running. This is a great way to build applications that are highly scalable and cost-effective.
